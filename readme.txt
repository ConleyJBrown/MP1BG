World Flags Quiz

I created this project for Wisconsin Digital Skills Bootcamp milestone project 1. 
The assignment was to create a simple web game using HTML, Javascript and CSS. I decided
that my game would be a quiz for identifying the different flags used by nations around the 
world to identify themselves. I've always enjoyed geography and learning about the meanings 
of the various flags countries have adopted. The quiz contains 204 different flags, including
the 197 commonly recognized independent nations as well as several countries which are constituent to
larger independent polities. The quiz tracks your score as you go and you can play through all 204 countries
or stop and start over at any time. Later, I'd like to add more funcitonality to the quiz allowing the user
to select specific continents or geographic areas to test their knowledge in.
